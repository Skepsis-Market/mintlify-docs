# Trading Strategies

Proven approaches to improve your Skepsis predictions.

---

## Core Strategies

### 1. The Information Edge 📰

**Concept:** Trade when you know something the market doesn't.

**When to use:**
- Breaking news not yet priced in
- Domain expertise (you work in the industry)
- Local knowledge (weather, events)

**Example:**
```
You see a credible leaker post "GPT-5 demo next week"
Market still shows Feb-March as most likely
You bet on next week's range before others react
```

**Risk level:** 🟡 Medium (information may be wrong)

---

### 2. The Contrarian 🔄

**Concept:** Bet against the crowd when they're overreacting.

**When to use:**
- Market moved sharply on emotional news
- Herd mentality is visible
- Fundamentals haven't changed

**Example:**
```
BTC drops 2% on random FUD tweet
1-hour market probabilities shift dramatically
You bet on recovery (mean reversion)
```

**Risk level:** 🟡 Medium (crowd can be right)

---

### 3. The Safe Player 🛡️

**Concept:** Wide ranges, high win rate, small but consistent gains.

**When to use:**
- New to the platform
- Building bankroll
- High liquidity markets

**Example:**
```
BTC at $97,000
You bet on $94,000 - $100,000 (huge range)
Odds: 1.3x
Win rate: ~85%
Small but consistent profit
```

**Risk level:** 🟢 Low (but low returns too)

---

### 4. The Sniper 🎯

**Concept:** Very narrow ranges, high conviction bets.

**When to use:**
- Strong analytical edge
- Specific catalyst known
- Small position size (it's risky!)

**Example:**
```
Apple earnings after hours
You calculate likely price impact: +$3-5
You bet on very narrow post-earnings range
Odds: 15x
Either big win or total loss
```

**Risk level:** 🔴 High (requires real edge)

---

### 5. The Hedger 🔀

**Concept:** Use predictions to offset real-world risk.

**When to use:**
- You have exposure to an outcome
- Want to reduce variance
- Not trying to profit, trying to protect

**Example:**
```
You're getting married outdoors Saturday
Good weather = great wedding, no bet payout
Bad weather = rough wedding, BUT you win $500

Outcome: You're happy either way
```

**Risk level:** 🟢 Low (you're buying insurance)

---

## Advanced Strategies

### The Barbell Strategy 📊

Split your capital between safe bets and long shots.

```
Total budget: $100

70%: Safe bet (1.5x odds, ~65% prob)
     $70 → potential $105

30%: Long shot (8x odds, ~12% prob)
     $30 → potential $240

Outcomes:
- Safe wins: +$35 (net profit)
- Long shot wins: +$170 (big win!)
- Both win: +$205 (jackpot!)
- Both lose: -$100 (max loss)
```

**Why it works:** Most of the time you grind small profits. Occasionally you hit big.

---

### The Bracket Strategy 🎾

Cover multiple adjacent ranges with decreasing amounts.

```
Center bet: $50 on $96K-$97K (3x odds)
Edge bet 1: $25 on $95K-$96K (4x odds)
Edge bet 2: $25 on $97K-$98K (4x odds)

You're betting on "around $96K-$97K" with coverage

Outcomes:
- Center hits: Win $150, lose $50 → +$100
- Edge hits: Win $100, lose $75 → +$25
- Miss: Lose $100
```

**Why it works:** Reduces the "off by one bucket" frustration.

---

### The Fade Strategy 🔻

Bet against ranges that look overpriced.

```
Market shows BTC $100K-$101K at 25% probability
Your analysis: More like 15%

You don't bet ON $100K-$101K
You bet on everything else (or specific alternatives)

If $100K-$101K is truly overpriced,
adjacent ranges are underpriced
```

**Why it works:** Exploits market inefficiencies without betting on unlikely events.

---

### Time Decay Strategy ⏰

Exploit how probabilities shift as resolution approaches.

```
Date market for product launch, 3 months out:
- All monthly ranges ~equal probability
- Uncertainty is high

As time passes without news:
- Near-term ranges get less likely
- Far-term ranges get more likely

If you believe "probably later than people think":
Bet on later ranges early, get good odds
```

**Why it works:** Time itself is information.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Over-betting Favorites

```
Range at 60% probability, 1.67x odds
"It's probably going to win!"
Bet 50% of bankroll

Problem: 40% of the time you lose half your money
Fix: Size positions appropriately
```

### ❌ Revenge Trading

```
Lost $100 on a bet
Immediately bet $200 to "make it back"
Lost again
Bet $400...

Fix: Take a break. Stick to your strategy.
```

### ❌ Ignoring Liquidity

```
Found 20x odds on a range
Tried to bet $1000
Slippage ate 30% of expected odds

Fix: Check liquidity before large bets
```

### ❌ Analysis Paralysis

```
Spent 2 hours analyzing a 1-hour market
Market closed before you decided
OR: bet based on outdated analysis

Fix: Timebox decisions proportional to market duration
```

---

## Bankroll Management

### The 1-5% Rule

Never bet more than 1-5% of your total bankroll on a single prediction.

```
Bankroll: $1,000
Max single bet: $10-50

Why: Even great strategies lose sometimes
10 losses in a row shouldn't wipe you out
```

### The Kelly Criterion (Simplified)

Optimal bet size based on edge:

```
Bet % = (Your prob - Market prob) / (Odds - 1)

Example:
Market: 4x odds (25% implied)
Your estimate: 35%
Edge: 10%

Bet % = (0.35 - 0.25) / (4 - 1) = 3.3% of bankroll
```

**Conservative approach:** Bet half the Kelly amount for safety.

## Developing Your Edge

### Track Everything

```
Log each bet:
- Market
- Your reasoning
- Range selected
- Odds received
- Outcome
- Profit/loss

Review weekly:
- Where are you winning?
- Where are you losing?
- Is your strategy working?
```

### Specialize First

```
Don't try to be good at everything
Pick one market type:
- Short-term BTC? Master that.
- Tech product dates? Own that niche.
- Local weather? Become the expert.

Then expand.
```

### Paper Trade First

```
New strategy? Test it without real money.
Track theoretical bets for 2 weeks.
Did it work? Go live.
Didn't work? Iterate.
```
