*A story of how Sarah, Marcus, and Charlie predicted Bitcoin's next move.*

---

## The Setup

It's 2:00 PM on a Tuesday. Bitcoin is trading at \$96,450, and Skepsis has a market:

> **"Where will BTC/USD be at 3:00 PM UTC?"**
> 
> **Range:** \$94,000 - \$100,000  
> **Resolution:** 1 hour  
> **Current Liquidity:** \$10,000 USDC

The probability distribution looks like this:

```
$94,000 - $95,000:  3%   ░░
$95,000 - $96,000:  12%  ░░░░░
$96,000 - $97,000:  35%  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  ← Current price zone
$97,000 - $98,000:  28%  ░░░░░░░░░░░
$98,000 - $99,000:  15%  ░░░░░░
$99,000 - $100,000: 7%   ░░░
```

Three traders see opportunity.

## The Traders

### 🎯 Sarah: The Range Player

Sarah is a part-time crypto investor. She's watched Bitcoin all morning and believes it will stay relatively stable—maybe drift slightly up.

**Her thesis:** "BTC will stay between \$96,500 and \$97,500. The market is too calm for big moves."

**Her bet:**
- **Range:** \$96,500 - \$97,500
- **Investment:** \$100 USDC
- **Odds received:** 3.2x
- **Potential payout:** \$320 if correct

Sarah knows her range is in the "popular zone" so odds aren't huge, but she's confident.

---

### 📉 Marcus: The Contrarian

Marcus follows macro news. He just saw a headline about potential Fed comments and thinks there might be a small dip.

**His thesis:** "There's going to be a quick selloff. BTC drops to \$95K-\$96K before recovering."

**His bet:**
- **Range:** \$95,000 - \$96,000
- **Investment:** \$150 USDC
- **Odds received:** 8.3x
- **Potential payout:** \$1,245 if correct

Marcus is betting against the crowd. Lower probability means better odds—but higher risk.

---

### 🎰 Charlie: The Sniper

Charlie is a day trader who watches order books obsessively. He noticed unusual buy pressure building and thinks a quick pump is coming.

**His thesis:** "Whales are accumulating. We're going to see \$98K+ within the hour."

**His bet:**
- **Range:** \$98,000 - \$98,500 (narrow range)
- **Investment:** \$50 USDC
- **Odds received:** 12x
- **Potential payout:** \$600 if correct

Charlie's taking a high-risk, high-reward approach with a very narrow range.

---

## The Hour Passes

**2:15 PM:** BTC dips to \$96,200. Marcus feels validated. Sarah's not worried.

**2:30 PM:** BTC recovers to \$96,600. Sarah's looking good.

**2:45 PM:** Suddenly, buying pressure. BTC jumps to \$97,100.

**2:55 PM:** Another push. \$97,400... \$97,600... \$97,800...

**3:00 PM - Resolution:** BTC closes at **\$97,650**

## The Results

| Trader | Range | Result | Outcome |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| Sarah | \$96,500 - \$97,500 | ❌ LOSE | \$97,650 was just above her range |
| Marcus | \$95,000 - \$96,000 | ❌ LOSE | Price never dropped that far |
| Charlie | \$98,000 - \$98,500 | ❌ LOSE | Close, but didn't quite reach |

**Plot twist:** Nobody won this round. The outcome landed in \$97,500 - \$98,000—a range that had ~20% probability but none of our traders bet on.

## The Lessons

### 1. Edge Cases Happen
Sarah was only \$150 away from winning. In binary markets, she'd have been right ("BTC stays under \$98K"). Here, precision matters.

### 2. The Crowd Isn't Always Wrong
The distribution showed \$96K-\$98K as most likely (~78% combined). The outcome landed right in that zone—just not where our traders specified.

### 3. Risk/Reward Trade-offs
| Trader | Risk Style | Odds | Outcome |
|--------|-----------|------|---------|
| Sarah | Conservative | 3.2x | Narrow miss |
| Marcus | Contrarian | 8.3x | Wrong direction |
| Charlie | High-risk sniper | 12x | Close but no cigar |

### 4. You Can Always Hedge
If Sarah had split her \$100 into two bets:
- \$70 on \$96,500 - \$97,500 (3.2x)
- \$30 on \$97,500 - \$98,500 (5x)

She would have won \$150 on the second bet, netting +\$50 overall.

## What Would You Have Bet?

Looking at that distribution, where would you have placed your range?

The beauty of continuous markets: **there's no single "right" answer—just different risk/reward profiles for different beliefs.**
