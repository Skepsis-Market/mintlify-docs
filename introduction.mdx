## Precision Pays

The world isn't black and white. Why are your bets?

Most prediction markets (like Polymarket) force you into binary **Yes/No** boxes. They are blunt instruments. If you have a specific, high-conviction thesis, you leave money on the table every time you use them.

**Skepsis is different.** We are a **continuous outcome market**. We let you bet on the exact range where an outcome will land.

### The "Precision Premium" Example

<Frame caption="The Precision Premium: Same market move, 5x higher payout for predicting the specific range.">
  <img src="/images/precision-chart-v2.svg" alt="Precision Premium Chart Comparison" />
</Frame>

Imagine Bitcoin is at **\$95,000**. You've done the analysis, and you are confident it will end the week between **\$98,000 and \$99,000**.

Here is the difference between a binary bet and a Skepsis bet:

| | Binary Market (Polymarket) | Skepsis |
|---|---|---|
| **The Question** | "Will BTC > \$97k?" | "Price of BTC?" |
| **Your Bet** | YES | Range: \$98k - \$99k |
| **The Crowd** | 50/50 split | Spread across \$90k-\$110k |
| **The Odds** | ~2.0x (Double your money) | **~10.0x (Ten times your money)** |
| **The Result** | BTC hits \$98.5k. You win. | BTC hits \$98.5k. You win. |

**Same outcome. 5x more profit.**

Why? Because on the binary market, your specific insight ("It will stop at \$99k") was priced the same as the generic "It will go up" view. On Skepsis, you were paid for your **precision**.

## The Sniper vs. The Shotgun

*   **Binary Markets are Shotguns:** Good for hitting broad targets ("Up", "Down", "Yes", "No"). Low risk of missing, but low reward for accuracy.
*   **Skepsis is a Sniper Rifle:** Built for traders who know their target. Higher difficulty, but massive rewards for hitting the bullseye.
