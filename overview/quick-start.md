## Step 3: Understand the Market

When you open a market, you'll see:

### The Probability Distribution
A chart showing where the crowd thinks the outcome will land. Peaks = high probability areas. Valleys = opportunities.

### Current Range Odds
Example for a BTC market:
```
$94,000 - $95,000  →  12x odds (8% probability)
$95,000 - $96,000  →  6x odds (17% probability)  
$96,000 - $97,000  →  4x odds (25% probability)  ← Most popular
$97,000 - $98,000  →  5x odds (20% probability)
$98,000 - $99,000  →  8x odds (12% probability)
```

<Note>
**Pro tip:** Higher odds = lower probability but bigger payout. Find ranges where you disagree with the crowd!
</Note>

## Step 4: Place Your Bet

1. **Select your range** — Click and drag on the chart to highlight your target range.
2. **Enter your amount** — How much USDC you want to risk.
3. **Review your quote:**
   - **Cost:** What you'll pay
   - **Potential payout:** What you'll win if correct
   - **Odds:** Your multiplier (e.g., 5.2x)
4. **Click "Place Bet"**
5. **Confirm in your wallet**

> **Your odds:** 4.2x  
> **If you win:** $210 USDC (guaranteed)  
> **If you lose:** $0 (you lose your $50)
